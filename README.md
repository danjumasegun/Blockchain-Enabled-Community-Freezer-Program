# Blockchain-Enabled Community Freezer Program

A decentralized platform for managing shared community freezer facilities that improves food security, reduces waste, and facilitates equitable access to food storage and surplus distribution.

## Overview

The Blockchain-Enabled Community Freezer Program addresses food insecurity and waste by creating a transparent, efficient system for shared food storage. This platform connects community members with available freezer space, tracks inventory to prevent waste, allocates storage space fairly, and facilitates the sharing of surplus foodâ€”ultimately improving food security while building community resilience.

## Core Components

### Facility Registration Contract

This smart contract records essential details about shared food storage locations:

- Freezer/refrigerator specifications and capacity
- Location information and accessibility
- Operating hours and access protocols
- Power backup systems and monitoring
- Temperature logs and maintenance history
- Energy efficiency metrics
- Hosting organization or individual details
- Health and safety compliance status
- Cleaning and sanitation schedule
- Physical access mechanisms (keypad, RFID, etc.)
- Photos and facility documentation
- Accessibility features for people with disabilities

### Inventory Tracking Contract

This contract monitors stored food items and expiration dates:

- Item registration and labeling system
- Storage date and expiration tracking
- Food type categorization
- Temperature requirements verification
- Owner identification (anonymized if desired)
- Quantity and portion metrics
- Nutritional information (optional)
- Source documentation (home-grown, donated, etc.)
- Allergen and dietary restriction labeling
- Quality assessment at check-in
- Automated expiration notifications
- Waste reduction metrics

### User Allocation Contract

This contract manages space assignments for community participants:

- User registration and verification
- Need-based allocation algorithms
- Space quotas and time limits
- Usage history tracking
- Contribution metrics (volunteer hours, donations)
- Priority system for vulnerable populations
- Reservation system for limited resources
- Membership management for community-based models
- User agreements and responsibility tracking
- Reputation system based on responsible usage
- Community governance participation
- Education completion tracking (food safety, etc.)

### Donation Distribution Contract

This contract coordinates the sharing of surplus food within the community:

- Surplus declaration and availability notification
- Need-based matching for donations
- Distribution scheduling and coordination
- Recipient verification processes
- Equitable allocation algorithms
- Transport and logistics coordination
- Chain of custody tracking for food safety
- Feedback system for donation quality
- Tax receipt generation for donors
- Connection to external food rescue organizations
- Impact tracking of redistributed food
- Community event coordination for bulk distribution

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ethereum-compatible wallet

   cd community-freezer-program
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure your environment:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit the `.env` file with your specific configuration values.

4. Deploy the contracts:
   ```
   npm run deploy
   ```

### Registering a Community Freezer Facility

1. Access the facility registration portal
2. Connect your authorized wallet
3. Complete the facility details form
4. Upload facility documentation and photos
5. Provide temperature monitoring access or logs
6. Submit for inspection and verification if required
7. Receive your facility ID and QR code
8. Set operating parameters and access protocols

### Managing Food Inventory

1. Log into the platform and access inventory management
2. Register new items with expiration dates
3. Print and attach QR code labels to items
4. Scan items when storing in the facility
5. Receive notifications about approaching expiration dates
6. Update inventory when items are removed
7. Report quality issues or temperature concerns
8. Access inventory history and usage patterns

### Allocating Community Storage Space

1. Review available capacity across registered facilities
2. Process user applications for storage allocation
3. Assign space based on need, proximity, and program rules
4. Manage waiting lists for high-demand facilities
5. Track usage patterns and optimize allocations
6. Implement fair use policies and conflict resolution
7. Coordinate special needs (medical necessity storage, etc.)
8. Generate usage reports for community governance

### Coordinating Surplus Food Distribution

1. Flag items available for donation or community sharing
2. Match available items with registered needs
3. Schedule pickup or delivery coordination
4. Verify successful transfers and proper handling
5. Collect feedback on donation quality and process
6. Generate impact reports for community and donors
7. Organize community meals or processing events for bulk surplus
8. Connect with external food banks for larger donations

## Technical Architecture

The platform combines several technologies:

- Smart contracts on Ethereum (or compatible energy-efficient blockchain)
- IoT temperature and power monitoring integration
- QR code generation and scanning for inventory management
- Mobile apps for on-site access and coordination
- RFID integration option for facility access and inventory
- Off-chain storage for facility images and documentation
- Optional AI for expiration date image recognition
- Notification systems for critical alerts

## Community Governance

The platform operates under a community-governed model:

- Participatory decision-making on resource allocation
- Transparent policies for fair usage
- Democratic voting on program expansions
- Conflict resolution protocols
- Contribution recognition systems
- Balance between efficiency and equity
- Local adaptation capabilities for regional needs
- Integration with existing community food initiatives

## Impact Metrics

The platform tracks the following impact metrics:

- Food waste reduction (pounds/kg saved)
- Increased food security for participants
- Energy efficiency through shared resources
- Economic value of food preserved
- Community resilience during disruptions
- Geographic reach and accessibility
- Donation redistribution impact
- Carbon footprint reduction

## Use Cases

- Rural communities with seasonal harvest preservation
- Urban food deserts with limited storage access
- Disaster preparedness and response
- Hunting and fishing communities with seasonal surplus
- Community gardens with harvest preservation
- School and community meal programs
- Senior citizen food security initiatives
- Multi-family housing cooperatives

## Regulatory Considerations

- Food safety compliance integration
- Health department coordination
- Temperature monitoring documentation
- Appropriate liability waivers and insurance
- Compliance with local food handling regulations
- Privacy protection for vulnerable participants
- Donation liability protections (Good Samaritan laws)
- Energy consumption reporting
